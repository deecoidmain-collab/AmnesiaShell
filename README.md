Download zip arhive, and run "main.py" file in CMD or just run it as executable

* **Linux**

## How to use
On start, select terminal you need. My custom shell have only one command 
(and its not working) so now you can only use cmd and powershell (on windows) or bash (on linux)

On linux, when you selecting bash terminal - program just closes. Its normal. Its like "redirecting" you to bash.
